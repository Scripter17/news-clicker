# News clicker - A newspaper based incremental game inspired by Universal paperclips

## Notes to self:
- 5 currencies: Articles (ART), ads/article (APA), money ($ (or â‚¬/currency of the user?)), trust (TRU), Clicks per second (CPS)
 - Articles take 5 seconds to make
 - Trust starts at 100% and can go to 0%. The more trust, the more CPS and APA you get
 - $=APA\*CPS
